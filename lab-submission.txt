Through this lab, I learned many things about Docker vai 9 parts in the workshop doc. In Part 1, I learned how to containerize an application by writing a Dockerfile. This showed me the difference between an image, which is like a blueprint, and a container, which is the running copy of that blueprint. In Part 2, I practiced updating the application and rebuilding the image. I saw how Docker makes it easy to create new versions without breaking the old ones, and I learned how to tag images with version numbers. In Part 3, I learned how to share my application by pushing the image to Docker Hub. This taught me how others can pull and run my app, and I practiced using the push and pull commands.
In Part 4, I discovered how to persist data using volumes. This helped me understand that containers are temporary, but volumes keep important files safe even if the container stops. In Part 5, I learned how to use bind mounts to connect files from my computer to the container. This was useful because I could see changes in real time without rebuilding the image, which is great for development. In Part 6, I learned about multi-container applications. I saw that many apps need more than one container, like a web app and a database, and I practiced running them together so they could communicate.
In Part 7, I learned how Docker Compose makes multi-container apps easier to manage. Instead of running many commands, I could use one file called docker-compose.yml and start everything with a single command. In Part 8, I learned best practices for building images. I saw how smaller and cleaner images are faster and easier to share, and I practiced removing extra files and keeping fewer layers. Finally, in Part 9, I explored what comes next after the basics. I learned that Docker can be used in bigger projects with tools like Kubernetes, and I started thinking about how Docker fits into real-world development.
